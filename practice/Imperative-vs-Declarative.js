* Inheritance vs Composition
//- https://www.codementor.io/imbhargav5/extending-react-components-inheritance-composition-qo59dqili

-> Inheritance: It's a concept in js which allows one class to inherit another
                class's properties to duplicate behavior and add more features.
-> Composition: It's a technique which allows us to combine one o mores 
                components into a newer, enhanced component capable of greater
                behavior. Instead of extending another class or object, 
                composition only aims at adding new behavior.

* Declarative vs Imperative

-> Declarative: Declarative code tells the [what].
-> Imperative: Imperative code tell the [how].
